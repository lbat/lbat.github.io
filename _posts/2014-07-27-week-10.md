title: Week 10
---

Last week I have accomplished several smaller tasks and made refactorings and added unit tests to increase code quality:

* made call to automatic scheduler asynchronous
* added constraint that surgeries are only scheduled within available times
* added dialog to filter operation theaters in the daily calendar view
* added weekly calendar view
* added calendar color location attribute
* automatic scheduler: added difficulty comparator to increase efficiency
