Harsha and I talked about our project plan and features we want to implement until the end of features. We came up with the following list:

* functionality to adjust automatic scheduling manually
* manually lock surgeries (time is fixed and not changed by the solver once it has been adjusted manually)
* introduce surgery priorities
* assign surgeon (surgical team) to a surgery and make sure that they don't overlap
* schedule emergencies
* improve automatic scheduler
* develop benchmark tool â€“ to compare performance of different solver configurations
