I am proud to present you the first screenshots of this new module!

It is the first version of the scheduling page. It shows a daily view of all the operation theaters (ot) and offers functionality to adjust the available times. Within this period surgeries will be scheduled. A click on the grey area opens a dialog to adjust this times. The operation theaters are modeled as locations in the openmrs-core data model. I added a tag “is_operation_theater”  to isolate them from other locations. I have also added two location attributes which store the default available times. As already mentioned, the user has the ability to adjust this times for a certain day, or mark this ot as not available (e.g. maintenaince, holiday, ...). This information is stored with the help of the appointmentscheduling module. For each day and resource (=ot) an appointment block entry will be created if the available times differ from the default ones.

I have to admit that I expected to move forward faster this week. The reasons that slowed me down are:  It has been a long time since I have done some front end development and I haven't ever worked with jQuery before. 
Nevertheless, I am confident that I will increase my development velocity over time! 

Last but not least,  I want to thank Terry Hannan. He is a well respected Clinical Associate Professor, Physician and past President of the Australian College of Health Informatics (ACHI). He was so kind to read through my project proposal and share his long-term experience with me. Terry has over thirty years international experience in Health Informatics and e-Health. We discussed several aspects of the user interface, which will result in an improved outcome. He also sent me a link to the following [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGKdC1t-t4c), which describes several techniques to ensure that physicians open the right patient record. It inspired me to think more deeply about simple things as selecting the right entry in a search result table.

I am looking forward to further discussions!
