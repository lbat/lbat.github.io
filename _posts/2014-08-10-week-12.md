Time is flying! This Tuesday is already the deadline for the final presentation. Therefore I was working hard to add further essential features for the 1.0 release of the operation-theater-module. Since my last blog post I added support for surgical teams. The automatic scheduler takes care of any conflicts between two surgeries. Furthermore, I added a basic workflow support. It is now possible to create, start and finish a surgery. This feature is also essential when it comes to emergencies. In this case the system has to know wether there is a free operation theater or when the next operation theater becomes available. Scheduling emergiencies is the last big point that I want to accomplish. The rest of the time I will be writing documentation, fix bugs and further clean up the code.
