title: Week 2

During the last few days I have finished the basic webservice layer for the surgery entity and extended the api.
At the end of the week, I started to develop the scheduling UI. I came across the jquery plugin [fullcalendar](http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar/) from Adam Shaw.
Unfortunately it doesn't offer two features that are required for this project:
 
* resource view: it is not possible to define resources (e.g. operating theaters) that are displayed as columns in the daily view. [Open Issue 490](https://code.google.com/p/fullcalendar/issues/detail?id=490)
* available times: it is also not possible to define background events that define times when the resource is available [Open Issue 496](https://code.google.com/p/fullcalendar/issues/detail?id=496)

There exist numerous forks of this project which all extend the functionality in some way. Unfortunately their changes are not integrated into the main project.
I filtered out two attempts that seem to be "actively" developed:

* [AbleTech fork](https://github.com/AbleTech/fullcalendar): It offers a resource view but no available times.

* [Elhigu fork](https://github.com/elhigu/fullcalendar): Here it is the other way round - no resources but available times.

I also found a project from [Szab√≥ Rudi](http://www.pano360.hu/resourcecalendar/), offering both features, but it seems that it isn't actively developed. It is based on the fullcalendar version 1.4.5, while the current release is 1.6.4 - I wasn't even able to get the sources, because the archive was currupted.

There is already a beta of v2 of the fullcalendar available with many improvements like timezone support, and built-in internationalization. I hope that in the nearer future the resource view as well as available times are integrated in the main project. Till then I will use the Abletech fork, because having a resource view is a lot more important. I will see how to add the available time functionality later.
