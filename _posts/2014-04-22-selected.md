First of all I want to thank the OpenMRS team for the confidence they have shown me in selecting my proposal - it feels great!

During the next few month I will develop an Operation theater module for the open source project OpenMRS.
A short project description and self introduction can be found under [About](about/)

The Project attracted me in multiple ways:

* <b>Impact</b> - see my results being used in hospitals around the globe!
* <b>Giving back</b> - contribute towards a project that helps to improve the health care system in developing countries.
* <b>Background</b> - combine my two different educations (software development and medicine)

In this blog I will keep you up to date about the developing process, write about difficulties and moments of success :)

I'm really looking forward to the next few months!
