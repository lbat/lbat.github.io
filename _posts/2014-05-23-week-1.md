This week I laid out the foundation for this module:

* installed the reference application
	* [Tutorial](https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/projects/Setting+Up+a+Development+Environment+for+OpenMRS+EMR+2.0)
* created a running module using app- and uiframework
	* [UI Framework Tutorial](https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/docs/Using+the+UI+Framework+in+Your+Module)
	* [App Framework Tutorial](https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/docs/App+Framework+Developer+Documentation)
* started to create data model using JPA annotations instead of hibernate config files
	* [Openmrs Wiki](https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/docs/Module+Hibernate+Annotated+Classes)
	* [Hibernate JPA Annotations](http://www.techferry.com/articles/hibernate-jpa-annotations.html)
* added findPatient.page form coreapps into my module (adaption to findSurgery record is not yet finished)
* added jacoco code coverage generation to the build process
	* [Code](https://github.com/lbat/openmrs-module-operationtheater/commit/25d7ea2cb1efb69fccdd652b55c674f12518ec36)
* started to develop service layer
* started to develop webservice for surgery resource
	* [Tutorial for module developers](https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/docs/Adding+a+Web+Service+Step+by+Step+Guide+for+Module+Developers)
	* [Technical documentation](https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/docs/REST+Web+Services+Technical+Documentation)
* read tutorial about liquibase and started to write changeSet to create tables

Of course I have faced a lot of difficulties during this first week. The most tiresome ones were related to configuration issues. It also takes a while to figure out implicit conventions (e.g.: Which rest webservice url ends up in calling my getAll() method of my resource?). I am glad that there is a lot of documentation and code out there where you can have a look of how others solved the problems. This helped me a lot.
