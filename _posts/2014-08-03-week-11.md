title: Week 11
---

The main goal of last week was to increase the efficiency of the scheduling algorithm. Therefore I did a larger refactoring to move to a chained planning variable. I also introduced a nullable planning variable. I had to develop a workaround solution because optaplanner doesn't yet support nullable chained variables. A nullable planning variable is needed when all operation theaters during the planning period are fully utilized. In this case the remaining surgeries must not be scheduled because there is no timeslot left.
