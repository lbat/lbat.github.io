title: Coding is about to begin!
---

Time is flying and the community bonding period is almost over.
In the last couple of days my mentor and I refined the project proposal.
We concentrated on the automatic scheduling algorithm which should maximize the operating theater utilization while minimizing the waiting time for patients.
There is a whole lot literature on this topic out there - here a few papers (the last one is a literature overview):

* [http://apiems.net/conf2012/T2C4.pdf](http://apiems.net/conf2012/T2C4.pdf)
* [http://arxiv.org/pdf/1205.2108.pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1205.2108.pdf)
* [https://lirias.kuleuven.be/bitstream/123456789/165923/1/kbi_0807.pdf](https://lirias.kuleuven.be/bitstream/123456789/165923/1/kbi_0807.pdf)

We decided to implement the approach based on the first paper - it is an Integer Programming solution.

Furthermore I designed a first draft of the data model. I gave a lightning talk at this weeks developer forum about these two topics and received valueable feedback from the entire community.

I am very excited to start on Monday morning!
