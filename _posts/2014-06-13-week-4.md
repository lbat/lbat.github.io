title: Week 4

During the last few days I finished the user interface for managing procedures. Procedures contain necessary information about the operation - like intervention and operation theater preparation duration. This is important for the scheduling algorithm. At the end of this week I began to setup the environment for the integer programming solver lpsolve that I will use to implement the scheduling.  It is available under the LGPL license and offers wrappers for java and many other programming languages.
