## ... me
<img src="../public/profile_picture.jpg" />

My name is Lukas Breitwieser.<br>
(lukas.breitwieser --AT-- gmail.com) 

Iâ€™m a Master student in Software Development and Business Management at Graz University of Technology (Austria).

Additionally I studied medicine for two years and worked as a medical clerk in the University Hospital of Graz. I spent two weeks in the department of radiology followed by two weeks almost entirely in the operation theatre assisting the surgical team during orthopedic interventions.

I have a broad spectrum of interests and love bringing ideas to life.

Beside studying I really like doing sports. I enjoy swimming, biking, beach volleyball and many more. 
It really helps me to stay balanced. 

## ... the project
The operating theater (OT) represents one of the most critical hospital units, both in patient safety and financial terms. 
The correct management of operating theaters represents an important step towards meeting the urgent need to deliver high quality care with limited resources. [0] 
The goal of this project is to develop a module to complement the functionality of the EMR-System OpenMRS to achieve these goals.
